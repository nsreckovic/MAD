## About

This application is intended to show an understanding of the technologies we learned in the Mobile Application Development course, such as ViewModels, LiveData, persistence in database using Room, connection to Weather API using Retofit, connection to Google Maps API.

## Note
Currently, the [API](https://www.weatherapi.com/) intended for this project does not work, so the professor made a fake one that only returns random values ​​for the cities: Paris, Moscow, Beijing, Rome and London, and in all other cases the latitude and
longitude for Belgrade, and the name you provide in the request.
