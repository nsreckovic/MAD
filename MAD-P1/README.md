This application is intended to show an understanding of the technologies we learned in the Mobile Application Development course, such as ViewModels, LiveData, Persistence in SharedPreference.

The idea of ​​the application is to be a tool for Covid-19 hospital staff that allows them to more easily monitor the condition of patients.

## Credentials

The application does not have any special logic for authorization and storage of users. The current user is saved in SharedPreferences, and the authorization pin is hardcoded - **1234**.
