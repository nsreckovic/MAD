## About

This application is intended to show an understanding of the technologies we learned in the Mobile Application Development course, such as ViewModels, LiveData, persistence in database using Room, connection to Google Maps API.

The idea of ​​the application is to be a tool that allows you to bookmark your favorite locations, as well as to change and delete them.
