## About

This application is intended to show an understanding of the technologies we learned in the Mobile Application Development course, such as ViewModels, LiveData, persistence in SharedPreference, persistence in database using Room, data fetching from server using Retrofit.

The idea of ​​the application is to be a tool for students that allows them to see their class schedule, class details as well as the ability to add, change, archive and delete their notes.

## Credentials

The application does not have any special logic for authorization and storage of users. The current user is saved in SharedPreferences, and the authorization username and pin are hardcoded - username: **test** pin: **1234**.
